# Scripts Directory

This directory contains bash scripts that are called by justfile targets to keep the justfile clean and maintainable.

## Scripts

### Development & Local Scripts

#### `dev.sh`
Sets up the development environment by starting Docker Compose services (primarily the PostgreSQL database).

**Usage**: Called by `just dev`
**Dependencies**: Docker Compose, `compose.yml`

### Container & Registry Scripts

#### `push-container.sh`
Builds, tags, and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry.

**Usage**: Called by `just push-container`
**Environment Variables Required**:
- `GIT_REGISTRY` - Container registry URL (e.g., ghcr.io)
- `GIT_USER` - GitHub username
**Dependencies**: Docker, built container image

### Deployment & Infrastructure Scripts

#### `deploy.sh`
Deploys the application to Hetzner Cloud VM using Terraform/OpenTofu.

**Usage**: Called by `just deploy`
**Environment Variables Required**:
- `GIT_REPO` - Project repository name
- `GIT_HASH` - Git commit hash for deployment tracking
- `GIT_REGISTRY` - Container registry URL
- `GIT_USER` - GitHub username
**Dependencies**: OpenTofu/Terraform, `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars`

#### `ssh.sh`
SSH into the deployed Hetzner Cloud VM.

**Usage**: Called by `just ssh`
**Dependencies**: 
- Active deployment (terraform.tfstate must exist)
- SSH key generated by deployment (`infrastructure/deployment_key`)
- `jq` for JSON parsing

## Infrastructure

The `infrastructure/` directory contains Terraform/OpenTofu configuration for deploying to Hetzner Cloud:

- **`main.tf`** - Main infrastructure configuration with Hetzner Cloud VM
- **`variables.tf`** - Input variables for customization
- **`providers.tf`** - Required provider configurations
- **`terraform.tfvars.example`** - Template for environment-specific variables
- **`cloud-init.yml`** - Cloud-init script for VM setup and Docker deployment

## Design Principles

1. **Self-contained**: Each script should handle its own validation and error checking
2. **Environment-aware**: Scripts should validate required environment variables
3. **Executable**: All scripts must have execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
4. **Documentation**: Scripts should include comments explaining their purpose
5. **Fail-fast**: Use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling

## Adding New Scripts

When creating new scripts:
1. Add executable script to this directory
2. Update this README with script documentation  
3. Update the corresponding justfile target to call the script
4. Test both direct script execution and justfile target execution
